Query Execution.
Your program must execute ranked queries. Your program must
return the top 10 or 20 results according to the TFIDF scoring function. You must
implement conjunctive and disjunctive query processing algorithms.

Scoring Function. You should implement the BM25 or other scoring functions such as
those based on language models

Query Processing Efficiency. You should implement skipping in your inverted lists,
you should implement the nextGEQ() operation in your posting interface, and
you should implement a dynamic pruning algorithm.
