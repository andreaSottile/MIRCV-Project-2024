Inverted Index.
You must create an inverted index structure, plus structures for the
lexicon (to store the vocabulary terms and their information) and for the document
table (to store docid to docno mapping and document lengths). You must not load the
posting data into a relational database. At the end of the program,
all structures must be stored on disk in some suitable format.

Index Compression.
You should implement at least some basic integer compression
method to decrease the index size. Do not use standard compressors such as
gzip for index compression. Ideally, your program should have a compile flag
that allows you to use ASCII format during debugging and binary format for
performance.
